# Chlorophyll Camera
The chlorophyll camera app captures and processes images from an
Android phone and instantly computes the chlorophyll content of the leaves
throughout the RGB components based on the stud Digital images taken in
the field typically exhibit variation due to ambient lighting, shadows so the
leaves should be photographed under identical illuminative conditions
between 11:00 and 12:00 solar time in absence of clouds. Without
detaching from the plant, leaves were hand flattened by pressing them on a
white graduated support plane covered with a transparent sheet, to allow
easy leaf pixels capture at the same focal distance. The light source, the
angle and distance between light and leaf should be as much as possible
constant. All data are logged and geo-referenced, and can be emailed to
your PC for further analysis. You can vary area for which will be calculated
the average RGB components. It is also possible to mediate the RGB
values from different leaves. For chlorophyll estimation it is used an RGB
multiple regression model that can be selected for different specie and
manually modified for a specie not reported in the database.
